### Abstract
Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is a challenging task in natural language processing. In recent times, many large datasets and good models are public for this task, but most of them are for English only. Building a good MRC dataset always takes much effort, this paper proposes a method, called UtlTran, to improve the MRC quality for low-resource languages. In this method, all available MRC English datasets are collected and translated into the target language with some context-reducing strategies for better results. Tokens of question and context are initialized word representations using a word embedding model. They are then pre-trained with the MRC model with the translated dataset for the specific low-resource language. Finally, a small manual MRC dataset is used to continue fine-tuning the model to get the best results. The experimental results on the Vietnamese language show that the best word embedding model for this task is a multilingual one â€“ XLM-R. Whereas, the best translation strategy is to reduce context by answer positions. The proposed model gives the best quality, i.e. F1=88.2% and Exact Match (EM) = 71.8%, on the UIT-ViQuAD dataset, compared to the state-of-the-art models.
